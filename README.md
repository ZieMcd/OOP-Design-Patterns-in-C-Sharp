# OOP Design Patterns in C#
This repo contains examples projects for design patterns. Some projects will also have diagrams which I will put in this readme.

### note
The scenarios are very simple, They should NOT be used to decide when to use a certain design pattern. Their only purpose is to demonstrate the design pattern.
Also this repo does not contain all design patterns, only ones that I don't know very well and want to leant more about. 

# Creational design patterns

## Factory Method
The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects.
I used calculating tax as example scenario to implement Factory method.

## Abstract Factory 

Abstract Factory is like the Factory Method tho the Factory can create more than one different type of object

## Builder
The Builder design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

# Structural design patterns

## Adaptor

## Composite
Composite pattern can be used to make tree like structures. As example we will create a folder structures

## Flyweight
A way of creating alot objects with using to much memory
